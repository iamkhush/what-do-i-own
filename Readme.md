# App to store what one ownes

Idea is to make like an inventory, but tied to each user in the home.
Also tied to the purchases that one makes.

For home related expenses - idea is to tie it to the "ghar" user.

In the end, we would like to see charts of each user expenses, per month.
We could also add budgeting for each user.

Order sources
Card - Photograph of receipt  - I can use android ml kit to get text from image. https://developers.google.com/ml-kit/vision/text-recognition/android
    - SEB
    - Klarna
Swish
Web - EMAIL
    - Klarna  
Later we can build option to scan receipts / emails.
Also can create mobile apps around it to do it on the fly.
