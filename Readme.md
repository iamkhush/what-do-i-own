# App to store what one owns

Idea is to make like an inventory, with purchases tied to a purchaser.
For home related expenses - idea is to tie it to the "home / ghar" user.

# Next Steps 
- Host it on my old laptop and run it as a production service accessible locally
- Figure out way to automate adding receipts to the db
  - Photograph of receipt  - I can use android ml kit to get text from image. https://developers.google.com/ml-kit/vision/text-recognition/android
  - Open Banking
